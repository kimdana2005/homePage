                <p>A change in global temperature of 1-2 degrees could lead to regular floods that used to happen once every decade, but now several times a year.</p>
                 <p>The seasons can shift, giving more or less rain, which has a detrimental effect on the harvest in any case</p>
                 <p>Changing temperatures can increase the area available for diseases such as malaria to spread, particularly if the area becomes warmer and wetter.</p>

               <h4> Warming </h4>

               <p>Over the past 30 years, the average annual temperature in Ukraine has already increased by 1°C. All seasons in Ukraine have become warmer. According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, the average summer temperature in Ukraine increased by 1.3°C, the average winter temperature by 0.9°C, the average spring temperature by 0.9°C, and the average autumn temperature by 0.4°C. As a result, droughts intensified, the water content of rivers and lakes changed, and extreme weather phenomena, not typical for Ukraine, appeared.

        <h4> Droughts </h4>

        <p>Data from observations and scientific studies show that dry conditions have begun to prevail in Ukraine, and their intensity has increased.</p>

        <p>The study shows that with an expected increase in air temperature, even by 1.5°C, during the years 2020-2050, every second season may be dry.</p>

        <h4> Water content of rivers and precipitation </h4>

        <p>In recent years, the water level in the rivers of Ukraine during the summer period is lower than normal. Along with more frequent droughts and less precipitation in the summer, the situation can only get worse.</p>

                <h4> Paris Agreement </h4>
                <p>The Paris Agreement was signed at the UN International Climate Talks (COP21) in 2015. Already a year later, the agreement entered into force - immediately after it was approved by 55 countries responsible for more than 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                <p>The main goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep global warming on Earth within 2°C and to make maximum efforts to stop warming at 1.5°C. This means that humanity must limit emissions of greenhouse gases, which are produced by burning fossil fuels and cause global warming.</p>
                <p>The Government of Ukraine was one of the first to ratify the Paris Agreement. To realize this ambitious goal, Ukraine must abandon the extraction and use of fossil fuels, increase energy efficiency and build new facilities that produce energy from renewable sources.</p>
